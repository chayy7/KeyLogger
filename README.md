🔐 Keylogger using Python (Educational Purpose Only)

This project is a simple Keylogger built using Python and the pynput library. It captures and logs keyboard inputs in real-time and saves them to a local file (log.txt). The keylogger is designed strictly for educational and ethical use, such as learning how keylogging works, understanding security vulnerabilities, and testing defensive mechanisms.

🧠 Features

-> Real-time keylogging using pynput.keyboard.Listener

-> Stores keystrokes in a buffer

-> Writes logs to a file (log.txt) after a fixed interval

-> Clears the buffer to avoid duplication

-> Handles special keys like Space, Enter, Shift, etc.

-> Lightweight and easy to understand

📌 Educational Use 

Disclaimer

-> This project is created solely for educational purposes. Do NOT use this code to harm or violate the privacy of others. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Always get proper permission before monitoring any device.
